Hello everyone  
My name is Lev, I am a practicing data analyst with 3 years of experience.  

My portfolio includes successfully implemented projects on automation of business processes (development of an algorithm for optimizing prices at gas stations) and the construction of advanced analytics systems (a system for assessing the impact of competitors' discounts on the company's price positioning)  

My scientific interest is in the field of forecasting financial time series. In 2022 I successfully presented my master's thesis in this field. I would be glad to apply the experience in your company's projects.  

I am currently in Astana, but I am open to offers from other cities and countries.
